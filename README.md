## HTTP
HTTP is a core operational protocol of the world wide web. It is what enables your web browser to communicate with a web server that hosts a website. HTTP is the communication protocol you use whenever you browse the web. HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is a protocol used for transferring web resources such as HTML documents, images, styles, and other files. 

An HTTP requests consists of a method, path, version and headers.

The primary or the most commonly used HTTP methods are, GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. 
- The GET method is used to retrieve information from the given server.
