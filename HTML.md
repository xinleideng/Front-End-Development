# HTML
## What is HTML?
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. Hypertext is text which contains links to other text. Markup refers to tags and elements used within a document. HTML is simply a text file with a specific structure that consists of elements and tags. Also take note that HTML files usually have a dot HTML suffix. For instance, when you visit a website, the first page that is returned to the browser is often called index.html. 

The rules and structure for elements and tags are known as the HTML specification. The HTML specification is maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, as it is commonly known. Whenever the HTML specification changes, a new version of HTML is standardized, the current version is HTML 5. 

HTML elements with their opening and closing tags, and angle brackets build up an HTML document. These elements form the structure of a web page and describe to the web browser what to display.

## HTML declaration
Now you know that HTML documents are made up of elements and tags. But before adding elements or tags, we first need to create a standard HTML structure which starts with the DOCTYPE declaration. This notifies the web browser that is a HTML documents. 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>

    </head>
    <body>
        
    </body>

</html>

```
